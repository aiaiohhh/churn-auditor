## Segment 1 — Hook (10s)
"A customer just cancelled their subscription. In sixty seconds, they'll be gone for good. What if you could diagnose why they left and launch a recovery — automatically — before they even close the tab?"

## Segment 2 — Problem (18s)
"Customer churn costs SaaS companies one point six trillion dollars every single year. And here's the worst part — most teams don't even find out until it's too late. The data is scattered across Stripe, your CRM, support tickets, and product analytics. The warning signs are there, but they're buried. By the time someone finally notices and reacts, the customer is long gone. There has to be a better way."

## Segment 3 — Solution (15s)
"Meet ChurnAuditor — AI-powered churn recovery built on Google Gemini. The moment a customer cancels, ChurnAuditor intercepts the event, diagnoses the root cause with a dual-model AI pipeline, and triggers personalized recovery actions — all in under sixty seconds. No manual triage. No guesswork. Just intelligent, automated action."

## Segment 4 — Demo: Dashboard (12s)
"Let me show you how it works. This is the ChurnAuditor dashboard — your command center for customer retention. Every churn event is tracked in real time with risk scores, root cause tags, and AI confidence levels. You can see at a glance which customers need attention and what's driving them away."

## Segment 5 — Demo: Simulation & AI Pipeline (25s)
"Watch what happens when a customer cancels. I'll simulate a Stripe subscription cancellation right now. The event appears instantly on the dashboard. Behind the scenes, our dual-model Gemini pipeline activates. First, Gemini Flash performs lightning-fast triage — categorizing the churn reason and assessing urgency in milliseconds. Then, Gemini Pro takes over for deep analysis, generating structured output with root cause diagnosis, confidence scores, and a save probability rating. The entire analysis completes in under thirty seconds."

## Segment 6 — Demo: Dossier & Actions (25s)
"Here's what Gemini produces — a complete AI-generated churn dossier. At the top, you'll see the root cause analysis and overall save probability. Scroll down and there's the evidence section — every conclusion backed by real customer signals: usage patterns, billing history, support interactions, and engagement trends. But ChurnAuditor doesn't just diagnose — it acts. At the bottom, you'll find automated recovery recommendations. Personalized retention emails, targeted discount offers, success team escalations — all powered by Gemini's function calling capability. Each action is tailored to this specific customer's situation."

## Segment 7 — Architecture (20s)
"Under the hood, ChurnAuditor runs a sophisticated dual-model pipeline. It starts with Stripe webhooks capturing the cancellation event. Gemini Flash handles instant triage — classifying the churn type and routing to the right analysis path. Then Gemini Pro performs deep diagnosis with structured JSON output. Finally, function calling executes recovery actions across your entire stack — email, Slack notifications, CRM updates, and billing adjustments. From cancellation to recovery action, the entire pipeline runs in under sixty seconds."

## Segment 8 — Close (15s)
"ChurnAuditor — built for the Google Gemini API Developer Competition. It proves that Gemini isn't just smart — it's actionable. Every cancellation tells a story. We use AI to read it, understand it, and turn it into a comeback. Stop losing customers. Start recovering them."
